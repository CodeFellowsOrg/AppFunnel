    <h1>We liked your application!</h1>
    <p>
      Good news. You have made it to the next round of the application process for the Code Fellows bootcamp!
    </p>
    <p>
      In your finalized application, please submit the following two items as an “Update” as soon as possible:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) a URL to a private 1-minute (max) video of you introducing yourself and explaining "something technical."  This is an intentionally open-ended question - you can explain a "how" or "what" - and it can be outside of the software field (either way is fine). Please ensure the URL is an unlisted YouTube or Vimeo page without password protection.  We will not share this video outside our review team.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) a URL to your best-foot-forward code sample(s). If you do not yet have a github.com account, we highly recommend you set one up, add code there, and send us your github account URL. Otherwise, sending us a URL to a website that you have coded (to any degree) works as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you! We’re looking forward to hearing from you!
    </p>
